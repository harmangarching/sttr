## Description

<Paste the Abstract/Introduction here>

## Data Gathering
We utilize two different datasets Gowalla and Foursquare both of which are publically available and have been crawled from the respective websites. The datasets are available at [Gowalla](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html) and [Foursquare](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset#h.p_7rmPjnwFGIx9). However, we also provide a script here to fetch the data and place it in required folders for our codes.

Run following command in your terminal or command prompt to get the data
```
bash fetch_data.sh
```

<!---
The raw data for the datasets can be downloaded from links below:
- [Gowalla](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html): Download the two datasets present under the 'Files' section, unzip them and place the result files under './data/Gowalla/' folder
- [Foursquare](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset#h.p_7rmPjnwFGIx9): Download the files for 'Global-scale Check-in Dataset with User Social Networks', unzip them and place the result folder under './data/Foursquare/' folder
